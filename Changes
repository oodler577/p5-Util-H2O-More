0.0.1 Sat Dec 11 11:05:09 2021
    - initial module

0.0.2 Mon Dec 13 11:05:09 2021
    - bump to 0.0.2 without TRIAL so
      it can be installed via cpanm

0.0.3 Mon Dec 13 12:05:09 2021
    - `h2o` can now be properly exported
      via Util::H2O::More qw/h2o/;

0.0.4 Sun Jan 2 12:05:09 2022
    - no functional change, build only impacts
    - specified minimal Util::H2O version
      due to "-isa" not being supported
      before v0.14

0.0.5 Thu Feb 24 12:05:08 2022 
    - deprecating baptise_deeply in favor of
      supporting -recurse in the baptise command
    - add opt2h2o for efficiently using h2o with
      Getopt::Long (examples included)
    - added o2h, to be the "inverse" operation of
      h2o; it supports the -recurse option.

0.0.6 Thu Feb 24 12:07:08 2022 
    - POD fixes

0.0.7 Thu Jun 23 12:07:08 2022
    - using Util::H2O::o2h instead of the original
      implementation. Bumped req'd version of
      Util::H2O to >= 0.18 because of this.
    - Updated documentation and removed "experimental"
      warning. TPRC 2022 release!

0.0.8 Thu Jun 23 14:16:00 2022
    - for baptise created objects, needed to adjust
      $Util::H2O::_PACKAGE_REGEX to be more general

0.0.9 Fri Nov 25 14:00:00 2022
    - corrected some minor documentation and code
      examples for using opt2h2o with Getopt::Long

0.1   Thu Dec 16 14:00:00 2022
    - added h3o for bags of HASH refs, h3o and
      the reverser, o3h
    - added vmethods for ARRAY containers: all,
      push, pop, unshift, shift, scalar
    - updated POD, added tests for all new things
    - specified minimum version of Perl as 5.10
      in dist.ini and all meta data that follows

0.1.1 Mon Dec 19 15:00:00 2022
    - POD updates

0.1.2 Mon Dec 20 15:00:00 2022
    - POD updates

0.2.0 Thu Dec 22 15:00:01 2022
    - found and fixed bug:
      o3h was not working on ARRAYs
    - updated POD, added method C<a2o> intended
      for internal use; but some might find it
      useful

0.2.1 Fri Dec 23 15:00:02 2022
    - renamed h3o, o3h to d2o, o2d

0.2.2 Tue Dec 28 15:00:03 2022
    - added helper methods for use with configuration
      files: ini2o, o2ini, o2h2o
    - added a dependency of Config::Tiny for ini2o and
      o2ini

0.2.3 Tue Jan 02 15:00:04 2023
    - maintenance release, updating minimum requirement
      for Config::Tiny (2.28)

0.2.4 Tue Jan 17 15:00:51 2023
    - changed ini2o to ini2h2o, o2ini to h2o2ini to make
      the naming more consistent with already existing
      helper apps, like opt2h2o (sorry if this causes
      anyone problems; I don't assume many people use
      this too heavily atm).

0.2.5 Fri Jan 27 15:00:52 2023
    - documentation update only
    - added mention of h2o's "-arrays" in the d2o section;
      so "d2o" and "o2d" alone are probably not reason enough
      to use Util::H2O::More of the stock h2o with "-arrays"
      when dealing with complex results from a web API

0.2.6 Sat Jan 28 15:00:53 2023
    - incremented dependency on latest version of Util::H2O (0.22)
    - more POD wording fixes

0.2.7 Sat Jan 28 15:00:54 2023
    - fixed dist.ini to exclude stuff from repo that's messing
      up CPAN indexing (no-op)

0.2.8 Mon Jan 30 15:00:55 2023
    - added wrapper, Getopt2h2o that will 'require Getopt::Long'
      and then uses opt2h2o; it's perfect for hanging accessors
      on your commandline flag options

0.2.9 Wed Feb 08 15:00:56 2023
    - added 2 wrappers around Data::Dumper::Dumper to help with
      lazy debugging of data structures;
    - ddd LIST - iterates over the LIST, applying Data::Dumper::Dumper to each item
    - dddie LIST - same as ddd, but die's at the end of the LIST
    - POD updated to reflect these helpers
    - manually tested, no unit tests added for this

0.3.0 Thu Feb 09 15:00:57 2023
    - added tr4h2o for keys not appropriate for use as subroutine names/accessors
    - added backward compat wrappers, ini2o (ini2h2o) and o2ini (h2o2ini) due to
      unforseen impacts to users (who knew!?) of taking them away
    - added tests, POD
    - POD issues if found will usually just be addressed in the next release
