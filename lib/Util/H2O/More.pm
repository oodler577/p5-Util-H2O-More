=head1 NAME

Util::H2O::More - Provides C<baptise>, like C<bless> but creates accessors for you.
It does other cool things to make Perl code easier to read and maintain, too.

=head1 SYNOPSIS 

Below is an example of a traditional Perl OOP class constructor
using C<baptise> to define a set of default accessors, in addition
to any that are created by virtue of the C<%opts> passed.

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    package Foo::Bar;

    # exports 'h2o' also
    use Util::H2O::More qw/baptise/;
      
    sub new {
      my $pkg    = shift;
      my %opts   = @_;
      
      # replaces bless, defines default constructures and creates
      # constructors based on what's passed into %opts
      
      my $self = baptise \%opts, $pkg, qw/bar haz herp derpes/;
       
      return $self;
    }
     
    1;

Then on a caller script,

    use strict;
    use warnings;
     
    use Foo::Bar;
     
    my $foo = Foo::Bar->new(some => q{thing}, else => 4);
     
    print $foo->some . qq{\n};
     
    # set bar via default accessor
    $foo->bar(1);
    print $foo->bar . qq{\n};
    
    # default accessors also available from the class defined
    # above,
    #   $foo->haz, $foo->herp, $foo->derpes
    
    # and from the supplied tuple,
    #   $foo->else

It is easy to create an I<OOP> module using C<baptise> instead of
C<bless>, which means it includes accessors (thanks to C<Util::H2O::h2o>).
In most cases, C<baptise> can be used as a drop-in replacement for
C<bless>.

For more examples, please look at the classes created for the unit
tests contained in C<t/lib>.

NB: There are other useful methods, so please read all of the POD.
This section simply covers C<baptise>, which was the first method
based on C<Util::H2O::h2o> presented in this module. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The primary method, C<baptise>, essentially provides the same
interface as the core keyword C<bless> with an additional I<slurpy>
third parameter where one may specify a list of default accessors.

Ultimately C<h2o> provides a very compelling approach that allows
one to incrementally add I<OOP> into their Perl. At the very least
it makes dealing with C<HASH> references much easier, and without
the committment to a full Perl I<OOP> framework. Perl is meant to
be I<multi-paradigm>, which means that it should be easy to mix the
best of different methods into one glorious creation. L<Util::H2O>,
and by extension, C<Util::H2O::More>; seeks to accomplish making it
possible for I<OOP> concepts.

C<Util::H2O::h2o> is a deceptively powerful tool that, above all, makes
it I<easy> and I<fun> to add accessors to I<ad hoc> C<HASH>references
that many Perl developers like to use and that get returned,
I<unblessed> by many popular modules. For example, L<HTTP::Tiny>,
L<Web::Scraper>, and the more common I<select%> methods L<DBI>
flavors implement. In particular, any L<JSON> returned by a
L<HTTP::Tiny> web request is not just ublessed, but still serialized.
Yet another great example is the configuration object returned by
the very popular module, L<Config::Tiny>.

Still more useful utilities may be built upon C<h2o>, e.g.; C<d2o>
which is able to handle data structures that contain C<HASH> references
buried or nested arbitrarily within C<ARRAY> references.

For example, C<d2o> cleans things up very nicely for dealing with
web APIs:

  my $response = h2o HTTP::Tiny->get($JSON_API_URL);
  die if not $response->success; 
  my $JSON_data_with_accessors = d2o JSON::decode_json $response->content;

Finally, and what started this module; the usage pattern of C<h2o>
begs it to be able to support being used as a I<drop in> replacement
for C<bless>.  But is does a fine job as serving
as the I<basis> for a I<better bless>.

This module also provides additional methods built using C<h2o>
or C<o2h> from L<Util::H2O> that allow for the incremental addition
of I<OOP> into existing or small scale Perl code without having to
fully commit to a Perl I<OOP> framework or compromise one's personal
Perl style.

C<Util::H2O::More> now provides a wrapper method now, C<d2o>
that will find and I<objectify> all C<HASH> refs contained in
C<ARRAY>s at any level, no matter how deep. This ability is
very useful for dealing with modern services that return C<ARRAY>s
of C<HASH>, traditional L<DBI> queries, and other modules that can
provide C<LIST>s of C<HASH> refs,  such as L<Web::Scraper>.

C<d2o> and C<o2d> would not have been added if the author of this
module had been keeping up with the latest features of C<Util::H2O>.
If nested data structure support is what you need, please see if
C<h2o>'s C<-array> is what you want; it tells C<h2o> to descende into
C<ARRAY>s and applies C<h2o -recurse> to them if found; this is
extremely useful for dealing with data structures generated from
deserializing JSON (e.g.,).

This module provides some other compelling methods, such as those
implementing the I<cookbook> suggestions described in C<Util::H2O>.
Which make it easier to deal with modules such as L<Config::Tiny>
(C<ini2h2o>, C<h2o2ini>), handle non-compliant keys C<tr4h2o>, or 
even provide convient access to C<Data::Dumper> (via C<ddd>).

You may have come here for the C<baptise>, but stay for the other
stuff -all built with the purpose of showing people I<the way> to
cleaning up their Perl with C<Util::H2O>!


=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<baptise REF, PKG, LIST>

Takes the same first 2 parameters as C<bless>; with the addition
of a list that defines a set of default accessors that do not
rely on the top level keys of the provided hash reference.

The B<-recurse> option:

Like C<baptise>, but creates accessors recursively for a nested
hash reference. Uses C<h2o>'s C<-recurse> flag.

Note: The accessors created in the nested hashes are handled
directly by C<h2o> by utilizing the C<-recurse> flag. This means
that they will necessarily be blessed using the unchangable
behavior of C<h2o>, which maintains the name space of C<Util::H2O::_$hash>
even if C<h2o> is passed with the C<-isa> and C<-class> flags,
which are both utilized to achieve the effective outcome of
C<baptise> and C<bastise -recurse>.

=head2 C<tr4h2o REF>

Replaces all characters not considered legal for subroutines or accessors
methods with an underscore, C<_>. It is taken directly from the L<Util::H2O>
cookbook on dealing with keys that are not compliant. However the solution used
internally to this module doesn't use C<List::Util>'s C<pairmap> method due
to some issues encountered during the development of C<tr4h2o>.

C<tr4h2o> provides a way to retreive the original LIST of offensive  keys, C<__og_keys>.

The following example is sufficient to demonstrate it's use, and again, it is
taken straight from the C<Util::H2O> POD.

  use Util::H2O::More qw/h2o tr4h2o ddd/;
  
  my $hash = { "foo bar" => 123, "quz-ba%z" => 456 };
  my $obj  = h2o tr4h2o $hash;
  print $obj->foo_bar, $obj->quz_ba_z, "\n";    # prints "123456
  
  # inspect new structure
  ddd $obj;            # Data::Dumper::Dumper 
  ddd $obj->__og_keys; # Data::Dumper::Dumper

Output:

  123456
  $VAR1 = bless( {
                   '__og_keys' => {
                                    'foo_bar' => 'foo bar',
                                    'quz_ba_z' => 'quz-ba%z'
                                  },
                   'quz_ba_z' => 456,
                   'foo_bar' => 123
                 }, 'Util::H2O::_7a1ad8c03918' );
  $VAR1 = {
            'foo_bar' => 'foo bar',
            'quz_ba_z' => 'quz-ba%z'
          };

Note: this is not applied to recursive data structures, something like that
would best be supported upstream by C<Util::H2O> using a flag like C<-tr> that
assumes transliteration using, C<tr/a-zA-Z0-9/_/c>.

=head2 C<Getopt2h2o REF, REF, LIST>

Wrapper around the idiom enabled buy C<opt2h2o>. It even will C<require>
C<Getopt::Long>. Usage:

  use Util::H2O::More qw/Getopt2h2o/;
  my $opts_ref = Getopt2h2o \@ARGV, { n => 10 }, qw/f=s n=i/;

The first argument is the a refernece to the C<@ARGV> array (or equivalent),
the second argument is the initial state of the hash to be objectified by
C<h2o>, the rest of the arguments is an array containing the C<Getopt::Long>
argument description.

This methods was created because even C<opt2h2o> was too much typing :-).

=head2 C<opt2h2o LIST>

Handy function for working with C<Getopt::Long>, which takes a list of options
meant for C<Getopt::Long>; and extracts the flag names so that they may be
used to create default accessors without having more than one list. E.g.,

    use Getopt::Long qw//;
    my @opts = (qw/option1=s options2=s@ option3 option4=i o5|option5=s/);
    my $o = h2o {}, opt2h2o(@opts);
    Getopt::Long::GetOptionsFromArray( \@ARGV, $o, @opts ); # Note, @ARGV is passed by reference
    
    # now options are all available as accessors, e.g.:
    if ($o->option3) {
      do_the_thing();
    }

Note: default values for options may still be placed inside of the anonymous
hash being I<objectified> via C<h2o>. This will work perfectly well with
C<baptise> and friends.

    use Getopt::Long qw//;
    my @opts = (qw/option1=s options2=s@ option3 option4=i o5|option5=s/);
    my $o = h2o { option1 => q{foo} }, opt2h2o(@opts);
    Getopt::Long::GetOptionsFromArray( \@ARGV, $o, @opts ); # Note, @ARGV is passed by reference 

    # ...
    # now $o can be used to query all possible options, even if they were
    # never passed at the commandline 

=head2 C<yaml2h2o FILENAME_OR_YAML_STRING>

Takes a single parameter that may be the name of a YAML file (in which case
it uses L<YAML>'s C<LoadFile>) or as a string of YAML (in which case it uses
L<YAML>'s C<Load> to parse it). If either C<YAML::LoadFile> or C<YAML::Load>
fails and throws an exception, it will not be caught and propagate to the
caller of C<yaml2h2o>.

Note: C<YAML> may contain more than one serialized object (separated by a
line with C<---\n>. Therefore C<yaml2h2o> should be treated as returning a
list of C<d2o>'d objects.

For example, say the YAML file looks like the following, saved as C<myfile.yaml>:

    host:     localhost 
    port:     3306

      port:    80

Then the one may use the C<yaml2h2o> as follows:

  my @objects_from_yaml = yaml2h2o q{/path/to/myfile.yaml>;

And C<@objects_from_yaml> will have 2 objects in it, but having been C<bless>ed
with accessors via the C<d2o> command, which will detect and handle properly lists.

If known ahead of time how many serialized objects C<myfile.yaml> would have
contained, then this is also a useful way to call it:

  my ($dbconfig, $devices) = yaml2h2o q{/path/to/myfile.yaml};

More exotic C<YAML> files may break C<yaml2h2o>; this method was added to support
simple C<YAML>. YAML can be used to encode a lot of things that we do not need.

If you just need, e.g., the C<$dbconfig>; then this trick would apply well also:

  my ($dbconfig, undef) = yaml2h2o q{/path/to/myfile.yaml};

Similarly, the following works as expected. The only different is that C<$YAML>
contains a string.

  my $YAML =<< EOYAML;
  ---
  database:
    host:     localhost 
    port:     3306
    db:       users 
    username: appuser 
    password: 1uggagel2345 
  ---
  devices:
    copter1:
      active:  1
      macaddr: a0:ff:6b:14:19:6e
      host:    192.168.0.14
      port:    80
    thingywhirl:

      port:    80
  EOYAML
  
  my ($dbconfig, $devices) = yaml2h2o $YAML;

=head3 C<yaml2h2o> May C<die>!

If whatever is passed to C<yaml2h2o> looks like neither a block of YAML or a file
name, an exception will be thrown with an error saying as much.

=head3 Note on Serialization to YAML

There is no C<o2yaml> that serializes an object to a file. One may be provided
at a later date. If you're reading this and want it, please create an issue at
the Github repository to request it (or other things).

See also, C<o2h>, which returns the pure underlying Perl data structure that is
objectified by C<h2o>, C<baptise>, C<ini2h2o>, C<yaml2h2o>, C<d2o>, etc.

=head2 C<yaml2o FILENAME>

Alias to C<yaml2h2o> for backward compatibility. I made the same inconsistent choice
when originally adding C<YAML> support in the naming, so this is just a shim to
bridge that gap.

=head2 C<ini2h2o FILENAME>

Takes the name of a file, uses L<Config::Tiny> to open it, then gives it
accessors using internally, C<o2h2o>, described below.

Given some configuration file using INI:

  [section1]
  var1=foo
  var2=bar
  
  [section2]
  var3=herp
  var4=derp

We can parse it with L<Config::Tiny> and objectify it with C<h2o>:

  use Util::H2O::More qw/ini2h2o/;
  my $config = ini2h2o qq{/path/to/my/config.ini}
  # ... $config now has accessors based Config::Tiny's read of config.ini

C<ini2o> is provided as a wrapper because this method was renamed in 0.2.4.

=head2 C<h2o2ini REF, FILENAME>

Takes and object created via C<ini2h2o> and writes it back out to C<FILENAME>
in the proper I<INI> format, using L<Config::Tiny>.

Given the example in C<ini2h2o>, we can go a step further and writ eout a new
configuration file after reading it and modifying a value.

  use Util::H2O::More qw/ini2h2o h2o2ini/;

  my $config = ini2h2o q{/path/to/my/config.ini}

  # update $config, write it out as a different file
  $config->section1->var1("some new value");
  h2o2ini $config, q{/path/to/my/other-config.ini};

C<o2ini> is provided as a wrapper because this method was renamed in 0.2.4.

=head2 C<o2h2o REF>

Primarily inspired by L<Util::H2O>'s example for adding accessors to an
reference that has already been blessed by another package. The motivating
example is one that shows how to add accessors to a L<Config::Tiny> object.

=head2 C<o2h REF>

Uses C<Util::H2O::o2h>, so behaves identical to it.  A new hash reference
is returned, unlike C<h2o> or C<baptise>. See C<Util::H2O>'s POD for
a lot more information.

This method complements C<h2o> or C<baptise> very well in the sitution,
e.g., when one is dealing with an ad hoc object that then needs to be
sent as a serialzied JSON string. It's convenient to be able to get
the un<bless>'d data structure most JSON encoding methods are expecting.

B<Implementation note:>

Access to C<Util::H2O::o2h>, but adjusts C<$Util::H2O::_PACKAGE_REGEX> to
accept package names that are generated by C<baptise>. This effectively
is an I<unbless>.

B<Historical Note:>

C<Util::H2O::More::o2h> preceded C<Util::H2O::o2h>, and the author
of the latter added it after seeing it's usefulness in cases where
the ability to get a pure C<HASH> reference after having I<objectified>
was useful. A good example is the standard dislike C<JSON> modules'
C<encode_json> method implementations have for blessed references;
this also affects environments like L<Dancer2> or L<Mojo> that
employ automatic serialization steps beyond route handlers. Returning
a blessed reference would cause the underlying serialization routines
to warn or C<die> without using C<o2h> to return a pure C<HASH>
reference.

=head2 C<d2o [-autoundef] REF>

The optional flag C<-autoundef> will attach an C<AUTOLOAD> method to
each individual HASH reference object that wwill allow uninitialized
hash keys to be called as a method, and it will automatically return
C<undef>. See the L<-autoundef> section for more.

This method is essentially a wrapper around C<h2o> that will traverse
an arbitrarily complex Perl data structure, applying C<h2o> to any
C<HASH> references along the way.

A common usecase where C<d2o> is useful is a web API call that returns
some list of C<HASH> references contained inside of an C<ARRAY> reference. 

For example,

  my $array_of_hashes = JSON::decode_json $json;
  d2o $array_of_hashes;
  my $co = $array_of_hashes->[3]->company->name;

Here, C<$array_of_hashes> is an C<ARRAY> reference that contains a set
of elements that are C<HASH> references; a pretty common situation when
dealing with records from an API or database call.  C<[3]>, refers the
4th element, which is a C<HASH> reference. This C<HASH> reference has
an accessor via C<d2o>, and this returns another C<HASH> that has an
accessor called C<name>.

The structure of C<$array_of_hashes> is based on JSON, e.g., that is of
the form:

  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Leanne Graham",
      "username": "Bret",

=head3 C<-autoundef>

There is an optional flag for C<d2o> that will allow one to one to call a
non-existing key using its setter form, and via C<AUTOLOAD> will return
C<undef>, this saves some code and piercing the veil into the HASH itself;

For example, before, it is necessary to pierce the veil of the HASH ref:

  my $hash_ref = somecall(..);
  d2o $hash_ref;
  my @mightexist = qw/foo bar baz/;
  foreach my $k (@mightexist) {
    say $hash_ref->$k if (exists $hash_ref->{$k}); #...before
  } 

After, missing methods return undef:

  my $hash_ref = somecall(..);
  d2o -autoundef, $hash_ref;
  my @mightexist = qw/foo bar baz/;
  foreach my $k (@mightexist) {
    say $hash_ref->$k if ($hash_ref->$k); #............after 
  } 

=head3 C<h2o>'s C<-array> Modifier

As of version 0.20 of L<Util::H2O>, C<h2o> has now a C<-arrays> modifier 
that does something very similar to C<d2o>, which was released shortly after
C<-arrays> was released in L<Util::H2O>. Had the author of this module known
about it, he would not have created C<d2o>. Nonetheless, C<d2o> does some
things C<-arrays> doesn't do (and similarly, when C<o2h -arrays> versus 
C<o2d>).

The biggest difference seems to be that C<h2o> doesn't bless the C<ARRAY> 
containers or provide virtual methods. Be advised, however, C<-arrays>
is probably sufficient for the use case C<d2o> was originally create for;
i.e., to more easily I<objectify> complicated data structures obtained from
things like JSON returned from web APIs. the virtual methods added to C<ARRAY>s
is not something one would expect form C<h2o>, which strives to provide a
I<lite> or I<tiny> touch. The vmethods do make iterating over the C<ARRAY>s
easier, though.

=head2 C<o2d REF>

Does for data structures I<objectified> with C<d2o> what C<o2h> does
for objects created with C<h2o>. It only removes the blessing from
C<Util::H2O::> and C<Util::H2O::More::__a2o> references.

=head2 C<a2o REF>

Used internally.

Used internally to give I<virual methods> to C<ARRAY> ref containers
potentially holding C<HASH> references.

C<a2o> is not intended to be useful outside of the context of C<d2o>,
but it's exposed in case it is, anyway.

=head2 C<ARRAY> container I<vmethods>

It is still somewhat inconvenient, though I<idiomatic>, to refer to C<ARRAY>
elements directly as in the example above. However, it is still inconsistent
with idea of C<Util::H2O>. So, C<d2o> leans into its I<heavy> nature by adding
some "virtual" methods to C<ARRAY> containers.

=head3 C<all>

Returns a LIST of all items in the C<ARRAY> container.
 
  my @items = $root->some-barray->all;

=head3 C<get INDEX>, C<i INDEX>

Given an C<ARRAY> container from C<d2o>, returns the element at the given
index. See C<push> example below for a practical example.

For shorter code, one may use C<i> instead of C<get>, for example, something
really pathalogical can be written either:

  $data->company->teams->get(0)->members->get(0)->projects->get(0)->tasks->get(1)->status('Completed');

Or,

  $data->company->teams->i(0)->members->i(0)->projects->i(0)->tasks->i(1)->status('Completed');

=head3 C<push LIST>

Pushes LIST onto ARRAY attached to the vmethod called; also applies the
C<d2o> method to anything I<pushed>.

  my @added = $root->some->barray->push({ foo => 1 }, {foo => 2});
  my $one   = $root->some->barray->get(0)->foo; # returns 1 via "get"
  my $two   = $root->some->barray->get(1)->foo; # returns 2 via "get"

Items that are C<push>'d are returned for convenient assignment.

=head3 C<pop>

Pops an element from C<ARRAY> container available after applying C<d2o> to
a structure that has C<ARRAY> refs at any level.

  my $item = $root->some-barray->pop;

=head3 C<unshift LIST>

Similar to C<push>, just operates on the near end of the C<ARRAY>.

Items that are C<shift>'d are returned for convenient assignment.

=head3 C<shift>

Similar to C<pop>, just operates on the near end of the C<ARRAY>.

=head3 C<scalar>

Returns the number of items in the C<ARRAY> container, which is more
convenient that doing,

  my $count = scalar @{$root->some->barray->all}; 

=head2 Debugging Methods

=head3 C<ddd LIST>

Takes a list and applies L<Data::Dumper>'s C<::Dumper> method to them, in turn. Prints to
C<STDERR>.

Used for debugging data structures, which is a likely thing to need if using this module.

L<Data::Dumper> is C<require>'d by this method.

=head3 C<dddie LIST>

Does the same thing as C<ddd>, but C<die>s at the end.

=head1 EXTERNAL METHODS

=head2 C<h2o>

Because C<Util::H2O::More> exports C<h2o> as the basis for its
operations, C<h2o> is also available without needing to qualify
its full name space.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head2 L<Util::H2O>

Requires C<Util::H2O> because this module is effectively a wrapper
around C<h2o>.

It also uses the C<state> keyword, which is only available in perls
>= 5.10.

While some methods are designed to work with external modules, e.g.,
C<opt2h2o> is meant to work with L<Getopt::Long>; at this time there
are no dependencies for such methods required by C<Util::H2O::More>
itself.

=head1 BUGS

At the time of this release, there are no bugs on the Github issue
tracker.
